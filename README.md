# Timelines App

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deployment to production (Firebase)

Prerequisites: The firebase cli must be installed and you must be logged in to firebase.

1. Run `ng build --prod`
2. When successfully built, run `firebase deploy` to deploy the app to firebase.

Firebase cli will show the production url in its output.
